There will be losers and there will be winners but the tide will raise many.It is hard to exactly predict the future, in fact we can’t do that! But what we can do is this our team works 24/7 on investigating markets and tokens.We are on top of press releases, news, rumors and inside information.We have personal contact with the people behind a project and we are doing technical analysis on tokens.This all has led to an overall 89% success rate on our trades.
